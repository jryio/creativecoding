## Creative Coding

[ Creative Coding ](https://creativecoding.recurse.com) is weekly practice of making silly, strange, imaginative, or bizarre things with computers.

Each week a new prompt is randomly generated and participants are encouraged to
make something which responds to the prompt.


### Evil Editor

Evil Editor inspects the sentiment of your deepest thoughts as you confide in
its unassuming prompt. However, there lurks something sinister, evil editor will
nuke your self reflection if it detects too much negativity.
Back to work monkey!


Evil Editor is a completely unserious project written in 90 minutes or less as
part of the [ Creative Coding ](https://creativecoding.recurse.com/) practice at [ The Recurse Center ](https://recurse.com).


The prompt for the creative coding session was:

> Would anybody want it?

I certainly wonder if anyone would want and editor, journal, etc. which actively
interferes with your writing or reflection.
